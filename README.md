# Unhandled Error: Invalid User ID in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling when dealing with user inputs.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to find a user by ID but fails to handle cases where the ID is not a valid integer.  This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that includes comprehensive error handling.

## Problem

The original code directly parses the user ID from the request parameters as an integer without checking for potential errors. If the ID is not a valid integer (e.g., it's a string, contains non-numeric characters, or is null/undefined), the `parseInt` function will return `NaN`, leading to issues when attempting to compare it to the user IDs in the `users` array.  This may result in unexpected results or even server crashes, especially if the error is not properly handled.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` adds error handling to address this. It checks if `req.params.id` is a valid integer using `isNaN` before using it to access the user.  If an error occurs during the conversion to an integer or if the user is not found, a meaningful HTTP error response is sent to the client.

This improved error handling makes the application more robust and prevents unexpected crashes.
